    <p>
      My name is Ethan Henry Lesar. I am a man who grew up in a little
      neighbourhood outside of town named Walmer Estate in Cape Town. The
      neighbourhood is ethnically and religiously diverse. I am highly
      enthusiastic about business. I got into coding because I previously worked
      in application development, but owing to COVID, I opted to quit out. I
      concluded that to be effective at business, I needed to learn about the
      future, which is totally online, as well as the services and products that
      are available online. As a result, I began to appreciate coding since I
      now see the internet realm in a different way.
